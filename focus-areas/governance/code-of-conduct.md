# Focus Area: Governance - Code of Conduct

## Question

**Question:** How does the Code of Conduct for the project support diversity and inclusion?

## 1. Description

A code of conduct signals to project members what behavior is acceptable. A code of conduct also provides enforcement mechanisms to deal with people who misbehave.


## 2. Sample Objectives

- A project member wants to know that a community takes diversity and inclusion seriously.
- A new contributor wants to evaluate a community for diverse and inclusive design, before investing any time in that project.
- A person wants to identify whether or not their demographic is protected prior to participating in a project.
- A grant, or award program wants to ensure that a project/org takes diversity and inclusion seriously by requiring the existence of a Code of Conduct.
- An open source project, or other technology company/org wants to ensure their partnerships, and allies take diversity and inclusion seriously as it can impact their own reputation and community health.
- A project member who experiences a violation needs to understand how to report the behavior.
- A project member, or event participant wants to see that the code of conduct is being enforced; and not just the potential for enforcement.



## 3. Sample Strategies

- Identify the location of the code of conduct as it pertains to primary areas of interaction and participation in projects and events (i.e., repo root, event entrance, communication channels).
- Survey project members about their perception of how a code of conduct influences their participation and sense of safety.
- Follow-up survey for reporting, around discoverability, clarity, and relevance.



## 4. Sample Success Metrics

_Qualitative_

- Code of Conduct passes Mozillaâ€™s Code of Conduct Assessment Tool
- Interview and/or survey community members to understand more about why the code of conduct does or does not meet their expectations.
  * What can the project do to improve the code of conduct?
  * What are some examples of how this community met or exceeded your code of conduct expectations?


_Quantitative_

- Browse the project website. If code of conduct is posted and there is a clear avenue for reporting violations, this criteria is fulfilled. (Note: ideally, the code of conduct would be discoverable)
- Survey participants about the code of conduct:
  * Likert scale [1-4] item: How well did the project meet your code of conduct expectations.
  * Were you made aware of the code of conduct and how to report violations? [i]
  * Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate in this project? [i]
  * If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction? [i]
