## Roadmap for 2019

We have five Objectives for 2019. [Read more](goals-2019.md).


## Background

### Problem Statement

The tech industry has a well-documented representation gap, and this issue is even more prevalent in open source communities. While there has been a marked emphasis on increasing diversity in these communities in recent years, numbers lag and the ability to foster inclusive environments remains challenging. With no standards or best practices for measuring inclusion, contributors, users and project teams lack the opportunity to make ethical, data-driven decisions.


### Opportunity

For the D&I Working Group, within the CHAOSS project.

CHAOSS mission from website:

> The CHAOSS community is developing metrics, methodologies, and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability. By measuring open source project health and sustainability, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency of open source project health and sustainability so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.

Community health cannot exist without diversity and inclusion. Diversity and inclusion is thus central to the CHAOSS project goals. See Objective 3 for more details on adding D&I to the CHAOSS mission.


### Goal

The CHAOSS D&I Working Group establishes and broadly communicates an ethical, peer-validated, research-informed, set of standards and best practices for measuring diversity and inclusion in open source projects, and ensures that CHAOSS project software can implement D&I metrics according to identified goals for inclusion with validation from key industry partnerships in open source.


### Work To Date

The CHAOSS D&I Working Group has between January 2018 and December 2018:

* established collaboration spaces, including a mailing list, GitHub repository, and weekly calls.
* defined 7 focus areas which group metrics.
* established a template for resource pages that describe why D&I metrics are helpful and how to measure them.
* filled out an initial 10 resource pages.
* presented at 5 conferences via presentations, panels, and tutorials.


## Metrics Focus Areas

We are compiling [dimensions of diversity and inclusion](./demographic-data/) that can be used in the following areas of analysis:

| Focus Area | Goal |
| --- | --- |
|1. [Event Diversity](./focus-areas/events/) | Identify the diversity and inclusion at events. |
|2. [Contributor Community Diversity](./focus-areas/contribution/) | Identify the diversity of the contributions within a community, and howe those different contributions are valued.|
|3. [Communication Inclusivity](./focus-areas/communication/) | Identify how we are communicating with contributors, and potential contributors.|
|4. [Recognition of Good Work](./focus-areas/recognition/) | Identify how we recognize/reward good work in our community.|
|5. [Leadership](./focus-areas/leadership/) | Identify how healthy our community leadership is.|
|6. [Governance](./focus-areas/governance/) | Identify how diverse and inclusive our governance is.|
|7. [Project and Community](./focus-areas/project-and-community/) | Identify how diverse and inclusive our project places, where community engagement occurs, are.|

Each area lists a collection of relevant questions. If you are interested in answering a question for your community, go to the associated resource page where we collect strategies for answering the question.


## Software Work

To be done


## How can you help?

This project is open to anyone interested in the topic of diversity and inclusion. And this includes several areas of work such as **diversity and inclusion** from a broader perspective, mining software repositories, **Python** development,
**tech writing**, people interested in **speaking** at events and others.

The collaboration guide is still in progress, but a first good step would be to introduce yourself at the [CHAOSS mailing list](https://chaoss.community/participate/#user-content-join-the-mailing-list) explaining a bit your interest.

Most of the work in the metrics side will be done through pull requests to the markdown files containing discussions
about the metrics used or to be used. This is the same method as when updating the software side of the project.
